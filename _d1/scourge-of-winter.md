“I will admit to a very personal satisfaction at the death of Draksis. He hurt my City and he hurt my friends. Few Guardians have ever assaulted a Kell in the throne room of his own Ketch. The entire Tower is abuzz at the chance to explore this downed Wintership, but more important, we’ve removed another Fallen nightmare from our worlds. We thank you, Guardian.”

—Commander Zavala
