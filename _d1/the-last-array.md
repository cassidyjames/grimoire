“The Terrestrial Array was Dead Orbit’s hope to reconnect to the lost colonies of our inner system. You succeeded where they failed. Though Rasputin seized control of the Array, that only strengthens our resolve to break the old Warmind’s firewalls and enlist its help in the wars to come. We must reach Rasputin, and make our case.”

—Commander Zavala
