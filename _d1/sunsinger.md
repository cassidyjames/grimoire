These are dark times. Humanity stands on the brink of extinction. We will carry fire into that darkness—a beacon to guide the way, and a pyre to consume our great enemy.

The Light saved us from death and forged us into weapons. We seek to understand it, to embrace it, to consume and be consumed by it. We hope to become radiant.

Our fellow Guardians need our power. Our civilization needs our strength.
