Only Guardians have the gift of the Traveler’s Light—the ability to channel its energies to project vast power into the world. Even without a firearm, a Guardian is a radiant engine of destruction.

While these abilities rise from within, Guardians master their power in different ways. Titans understand the Light as a force to hone through practice and strict discipline. Hunters roam and explore in order to learn, using dangerous methods to survive the wilds. And Warlocks study the Light and its inner mechanisms, confronting unfathomable mysteries in the search for transcendent might.
