Open yourself to the Light. Glimpse, for a few rapturous moments, the truth beyond the powers you wield.

A Warlock in a state of Radiance threatens to slip beyond the bonds of the material, shrugging off physical harm, channeling a torrent of abilities. Some may learn to elevate nearby Guardians, gifting them with power. Others, entranced by the Ghostsâ€™ power to reach beyond death, may learn to pluck themselves out of nothingness like the phoenix of ancient myth.
