“Those who have stared into the Void are not bound by the laws of space and time.”

The Traveler came out of the void that surrounds all things. Thus we know that the void is full of power. Thus we enter the void without fear.

Small minds will call your abilities blasphemous. They will compare you to the abominable Wizards of the Hive.

But you will not be held back. Gifted with the Traveler’s Light, armed with the secret physics of a lost age, you will tear reality asunder.

You will fear nothing, and nothing will not fear you.
