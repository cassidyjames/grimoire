“Taking down an Archon is no easy task. With the master of the Fallen Servitors gone, the House of Devils will scramble to protect their Prime Servitor. And securing an NLS Drive will let you join the fight beyond Earth. Mind the Speaker’s wise words. I believe he speaks for the Traveler.”

—Commander Zavala
