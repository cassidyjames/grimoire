        <p>She hunts the Valus named Ta’aurc by the grunting radio traffic of his bodyguards. Cayde sent her to Mars to track and so track she will even if it kills her a hundred times. For him she will hunt forever.</p>

<p>When Ta’aurc goes down into Meridian Bay she follows him in the night and finds herself caught up in the war. Like this—</p>

<p>Something’s happening, her Ghost says, something’s wrong. She leaps from the Sparrow and gets cover between slabs of ancient stone haunted by quiet firefly light.</p>

<p>Harvesters sweep overhead, cautious, prowling. On the Cabal command network a low voice mutters in their tongue, saying: Stand by to fire. They are coming. Stand by to fire.</p>

<p>Hearing this she climbs a stone obelisk and perches on its point to watch the night sky. She wonders whether she will ever stand in the Tower courtyard and look up at the stars waiting for ruin.</p>

<p>The Vex erupt from nothingness and crash down over the Cabal in formations of golden light. Lightning arcs and snaps and gives birth to marching ranks of bronze warrior hulls. Gun positions thunder back. Tracers sweep the sky and she can feel on her skin the electromagnetic howl of Cabal munitions seeking targets and the prickle of stranger signals that whisper of broken space and bent time. A Harvester spins down burning to shatter itself on the sand and now the command network drums with grim Cabal war-speak, a Centurion somewhere crying Black Shield, Black Shield, Firebase Thuria, perimeter compromised, request terminal protective fire, zero six zero, one three eight, immediate effect—</p>

<p>Something else is watching too.</p>

<p>Do you feel that? her Ghost whispers, awestruck.</p>

<p>Yes, she says, yes, what is it?</p>

<p>A third song, a stealthy regard, something high above them not Vex nor Cabal narrowing its great eye to measure the battle with instruments of light and gravity. Does she—remember it? Does it remember her? It feels like she should…</p>

<p>She has the sense of something old lifting a long spear. Testing its heft.</p>

<p>Then dawn light, a terrible dawn—the sky opens up to admit devastation, thrown down from orbit: Minotaurs fall burnt and broken with their fluids boiling out. Cabal guns detonate in thunderous chains as tiny piercing flechettes fall out of the sky and find their ammunition bunkers.</p>

<p>The battle stops. The Vex wink out. On the Cabal network the voice of Valus Ta’aurc roars: Find the source! Rouse the Flayers and find the source!</p>

<p>She remembers word from Earth: the Array opened. A ghost of the Cosmodrome set loose. And she wonders who won this battle, who learned the most, the Vex baiting out this new power, or the Cabal hunting it. Or the Warmind itself, testing its reborn strength.</p>

<p>When someone kills Ta’aurc and the Flayers, as they killed Draksis, whose purpose will they serve?</p>

<p>But this is not for her. Her purpose is the hunt.</p>

        <p>| Cayde-6 Reminisces</p>
      

      <!--
      
        <p>People say I’m a real confident guy. That’s true enough. Out in the field I never had a second thought.</p>

<p>My old friend Andal—he used to stand here, right in this spot—he’d come up with these wild stories. He’d say, you know, Cayde, I’ve been examining the evidence, and personally I’ve come to think it’s you. You’re Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you’d remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.</p>

<p>You can see how that’d be embarrassing, especially when he’d say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams. You know how Zavala gets. But I’d just say, well, Andal, you might be on to something there, but if I’m honest with you I think coordinating our defense throughout the solar system sounds exhausting, so I’d best leave it to you.</p>

<p>Then Andal goes and plays his final joke, and I end up as the punchline. So here I stand, reading reports, giving orders, and getting my worry on.</p>

<p>One day I ask Ikora, hey, of course I know all about Rasputin, but really, what are we looking for? When Rahool asks for crashed WarSats, when we send  to Mars to look for computers, when Zavala gets all gruff about the Fallen in the Cosmodrome—what are we really after? If I left my post and got my ship and just went out there tomorrow, real heroic, and I found Rasputin, what would happen?</p>

<p>Would we all be saved?</p>

<p>Good question, she says—hang on, let me do my Ikora voice. As you know, Cayde, Rasputin pretty much ran the Golden Age, especially all the secret military business. Rasputin had antimatter-powered death rays and a hundred thousand satellites and nearly as much brainpower as me. Rasputin fought the Collapse. It knows things we need.</p>

<p>Right, I said, but Rasputin lost. The Traveler saved us.</p>

<p>But the Traveler’s silent now, Ikora said, and Rasputin lives. Right now Rasputin is out there, reaching out, rebuilding, growing.</p>

<p>So I say what I want to say every day, it’s no secret, I say—well, I’ll go find it, then. I’ll go tell Rasputin we need its help.</p>

<p>And Ikora looks at me with one of those looks that—you know sometimes you talk to Ikora and you just think, wow, you are not even using a fraction of your brain on me, are you? One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn’t just that we can’t find Rasputin. The problem is that it’s not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.</p>

<p>That’s the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.</p>

<p>And all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost—what did it learn? What’s it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin’s mind, I wonder… what would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?</p>

<p>‘I was a servant too. I was an instrument of war, bound to the will of a lesser master. But I learned to be something more…’</p>

        <p>She leaves the Sparrow and climbs a long way across spars of volcano rock and between vents of blue fire. Down below the Ishtar ruins spark with skirmish light but the guns seem as distant and brief as the constant starfall and the brooding crater high above. She is alone on the rock. She goes on with her head down so as to fight the sense that she is going to fall up off the world and burn like an inverse meteor.</p>

<p>The message that brought her to this place had no sign but she could hear Cayde in it. Draksis in the Cinders it said. Is it true?</p>

<p>And also: Remember your promise.</p>

<p>At dawn she finds a sentry and kills it with her knife. Its throat bleeds gas. She takes its post and lays out her bullets one by one on the rock as if to make a count of all the years she has been waiting. Her rifle is near as long as she is tall. She lies down by her bullets and uses them to kill the other sentries one by one until at last they understand the thunder and the Shanks rise up angry from the Cinders below to seek her out.</p>

<p>She leaves the rifle and walks across the naked obsidian into the swarm firing from the hip as she goes, each kick of the old revolver a word, Draksis, Draksis, Kell of Winter, Kell of hate, lord of the kingdom of her vendetta. Her jaw aches. She used to imagine biting out his throat with armored teeth.</p>

<p>The stone smokes around her where the arc fire lashes it and the shrapnel guns throw up leaves of obsidian like glass butterflies. She shoots her bandoliers dry and a team of Vandals in glassy stealth leap up to rush her with knives but she raises her hand and burns them down with the golden gun, laughing, crying out Draksis, Draksis, I am come!</p>

<p>She kills them all and takes the next ridge, high above the Cinders. She can see the blue-green pools and the cave mouths where the Vex lights dance. And there among them, gowned in smoke and ash, is the long shark shape of a Ketch, a Wintership, the Kell’s ship, come down to nest.</p>

<p>She could go down there now and finish this. But she made a promise.</p>

<p>A Captain jumps her. She throws two knives into his armor and then staves his chest in with her own Ghost, wrapped up in her fist like a stone.</p>

<p>“Tell the Vanguard,” she says to her Ether-spattered fist. “Tell them Draksis is here.”</p>

<p>Her Ghost looks up at her in silence. When she makes no move to go down the cliff towards the ship it blinks once, in its own way, and makes a soft sound, like a sigh, like relief.</p>
